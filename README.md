# Jam Guitar for Android

## Objective
The main idea of this application is to provide guidelines and backing music to practice and expand a guitaristâ€™s vocabulary. Be it a beginner or an enthusiast who wants to explore the foundation the creating guitar solo and improvising. This app can help set him/her on the right track. 
As the number of guitar learners increasing day by day, I hope this app help solve the issues and clarify the learners who are stuck in playing the same chords repeatedly and help master guitar soloing further.

## Target Individual:
-	Anyone who is willing to learn and expand guitar soloing vocabulary.
-	Age 15 - 35

## My story
I started playing guitar when I was around 10 years old. I started with basics and after all these years I have come to play with backing tracks and solo over them with my style and my licks. Because making a good guitar solo requires a lot of things i.e. tone, timing, phrasing, etc. It takes a lot of time to master each of the aspects. People keep asking me the same question over and over again. How are you able to play like this? Well, I am going to put everything that I have learned so far that I used to develop my skills onto this app for them and also to all the guitar enthusiasts out there who can learn a thing or two from this app.

## Main Features
-	Lots of backing tracks.
-	Guitar scales, tips and guidelines i.e. major, minor.
-	Licks playthrough videos (Youtube link).
-	Including backing tracks from Jack Thammarat.
