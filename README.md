## My story
I started playing guitar when I was around 10 years old. I started with basics and after all these years I have come to play with backing tracks and solo over them with my style and my licks. Because making a good guitar solo requires a lot of things i.e. tone, timing, phrasing, etc. It takes a lot of time to master each of the aspects. People keep asking me the same question over and over again. How are you able to play like this? Well, I am going to put everything that I have learned so far that I used to develop my skills onto this app for them and also to all the guitar enthusiasts out there who can learn a thing or two from this app.
